                These books are categorized by the publisher as mystery and romance novels. Each novel
                is primarily set in and around the fictitious town of River City in the mountains of
                southeastern Tennessee. They may be enjoyed in any order since they are not part of a
                series, and none of the characters are repeated from one novel to another.

            <p class="lead">
              Archie Meyers was born in the foothills of the Southern Appalachians. As the chairman
              and CEO of a large international company, he has written and lectured worldwide on
              corporate ethics and effective management practices. In his acclaimed debut novel,
              Mountain Justice, he moved from the boardroom to the mountains of Southeastern
              Tennessee to set an intriguing tale of romance, abuse, vengeance, and murder.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              In his second novel, Summer Intrigue, Meyers uses the same venue to tell the story of
              Ty Montague, a successful Wall Street investment banker. After returning to his home in
              Tennessee, Ty becomes embroiled in a series of brutal murders while trying to resurrect
              a long-ago romance with the one woman he has never been able to forget.

              The scream quickly emptied the offices and brought employees running from both ends of
              the hall. Everyone on the floor converged at the desk where Megan sat, ashen-faced and
              slumped in her chair, speechlessly pointing to the contents of a small box she had just
              opened. The box and the accompanying note were still on the desk, but the box's contents,
              encased in a clear Ziploc bag, had slid off the desk onto the floor.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              When the police arrived, twenty minutes later, someone pointed to the box still lying on
              the desk, partially obscuring the note. To avoid fingerprint contamination, the officer
              used his nightstick to gently push the box aside so the full note could be seen.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Individual letters of various colors and fonts had been clipped from magazines and
              newspaper articles to create the two words that were carefully pasted on the sheet of
              plain white paper. The policeman's expression became quizzical as he leaned over to
              read the patchwork letters that spelled out an ominous message:
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              m O u N t a i N j U s T I c E
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Even before she had recovered from the shock of what she had seen, her mind flashed back
              to that day, several months earlier, when she had fled from California terrified by what
              had happened and what she had done.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Megan's spirit was indestructible; her face was not. She was having trouble seeing as she
              drove into the moonless Southern California night. Not because of the darkness, but because
              both of her eyes were almost swollen shut.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              She was a fugitive, trying desperately to get as far away from Los Angeles as possible
              before she had to stop. Megan wasn't running from the law-at least, not yet. She was running
              from her husband. Joe had almost killed her, and she may, in fact, have killed him. She had
              left him naked, bleeding profusely, and lying unconscious on the bedroom floor beside the
              broken lamp she had used as a weapon.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Megan had been terrified as she scrambled through the front door, leaving it wide open as
              she sprinted to her car. She was several blocks away before she was composed enough to dial
              9-1-1 on her cell phone and tell the operator where Joe could be found. She had been planning
              to leave for weeks and had already withdrawn half the money from their joint account and hidden
              it in her closet. His brutal attack and her retaliation had simply changed her departure schedule.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              She had taken only enough time to grab the money and a few clothes before speeding away from her
              neighborhood into the madness of the afternoon traffic. Leaving the city behind, she had connected
              with Interstate 15 in Ontario, California and followed it to the intersection of Interstate 40,
              which she planned to follow across the country. She crossed the Mojave Desert and was nearing
              Kingman, Arizona, over four hundred miles northeast of Los Angles when the physical exhaustion
              and mental stress finally overpowered the adrenaline rush that had carried her that far. With Los
              Angeles now far behind, her breathing had returned to a normal rhythm. Her destination was her
              mother's home in the mountains of Tennessee, more than two thousand miles, three days, and several 
              thousand light years environmentally from Los Angeles. It was almost midnight, and she was bone tired.
              The pain radiating from her chin to her hairline had settled into a dull throb that kept time with
              the beating of her heart. The constant pulsing was occasionally punctuated by a sharp pain that shot
              through her head like a bolt of lightning. Megan started looking for a cheap motel; she knew she
              couldn't make it much further without sleep.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Summer Intrigue</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Summer had defied the calendar and arrived early in the mountains of southeast Tennessee.
              It was a warm, tranquil afternoon with no hint of imminent danger as boaters flocked to
              the lake for a carefree afternoon on the water.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The teenager riding the Sea Doo was blissfully unaware that an assassin was watching as he
              sliced through the water toward "The Narrows," an area where the mile-wide lake shrivels to
              less than two-hundred feet before passing through a gap in the mountains that surround the
              lake. Inside the constricted passage, the lake becomes serpentine and crawls through a mile
              long stretch where the flow of water is almost strangled by the nearly perpendicular rock
              walls rising from the opposing shorelines.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The shooter, carefully concealed at the entrance to "The Narrows," calmly watched the jet
              ski kicking up a ten-foot high "rooster tail" as the narrowing of the lake brought it ever
              closer to his position. Even when it came within range, nothing in his composed outward
              demeanor indicated the anger raging deep within him. He intentionally slowed his breathing,
              followed his target through the rifle's scope, took one last deep breath, exhaled half of it,
              led the target by a few feet, and slowly squeezed the trigger. The recoil kicked the barrel
              up a few inches, but he quickly realigned the scope and robotically worked the lever action,
              racking another cartridge into the chamber. But a second shot was unnecessary; the first had
              been lethal. The bullet's impact had caused a quick reflex action as the victim's hand slapped
              against his breast, but there was no further movement after his body splashed into the water.
              All of the young man's tomorrows had been canceled in a split second. The immobile body,
              supported by what was now a useless life vest, slowly bobbed in the water, as the pink tinted
              circle that initially surrounded the body slowly dissipated. Although gravity was still causing
              blood to seep from the wound, the heart that had been pumping it was no longer beating.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The gunman, dressed in woodland camouflage, was almost invisible as he leaned against a large
              oak tree and watched through the powerful wide-angle scope. He didn't move until he saw an
              approaching boat, but then checked the area to make sure he had left no evidence, slipped deeper
              into the tree line, and slowly walked to the old logging road where he had left his car. His
              successful mission brought a sardonic smile to his face, but the smile belied the vicious fury
              that still seethed deep within him. His rage was far from abated.

              Dex was the best athlete in school; Marie was the neighborhood tomboy. They were best friends
              and next door neighbors until her family moved away when they were teenagers. Seven years would
              pass before they saw each other again. Now he was preparing to sign a multi-million dollar NFL
              contract, and she was a successful entrepreneur. Their unexpected reunion prompted an instant
              romantic attraction, but they could have never guessed that the transformation from friends to
              lovers would be the catalyst for a series of violent, tragic events that would soon dominate
              their peaceful Appalachian town.
